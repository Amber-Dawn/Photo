 <h1> Photography </h1>
  Photograhpy is an important part of the world. 
  Without it, you wouldn't know what the world looked like before you were born. 
  You would't be able to capture those precious moments in your life.
  Photography doesn't just mean pictures taken with a expensive camera and expensive equipment.
  By taking a picture of even yourself with your phone camera, you are being a photographer in some way.
